# What is different from source

I used algorithm and source code here to score 18th at Huawei Honorcup Marathon (http://codeforces.com/contest/1235). The task is very similar yet different from the task in the paper.
- The pieces will not be rotated.
- The number of pieces are rather small (8×8 to 32×32).

I tried to get best score by using my computing resources, fix bugs from `type2 = True` settings and try various parameters.
